# Em & Me Band Website 

## Description

The purpose of this site is to provide prospective fans and music fans to have a look at what we do and what we can offer to our local music commuity.

I wanted to create this website as I am a huge music fan and and musician and wanted to create my own bands website.

I built this website in order to showcase what I have learned so far through my Level 5 Diploma in Web Development through the [Code Institute] (<https://codeinstitute.net>)

Troughout this project so far I have grown in confidence using HTML and CSS and feel that I can code to a certain point and create a website that hopefully is user-friendly, something I previously could not but that is why I wanted to do this course.

From studying the course material and other resources on the web, I have learned lots of different ways to get the ideas dfrom my head in to the code of my website. It's been a a huge learning curve and not as easy as I originally thought.

## UX Design

### Project Goals

My goals were to make this website visually user-friendly and easy to use for the user. It would give the user a chance to hear and see one of our live gigs and hear one of our demo tracks. Also to make it established on all three devices such as mobile phone, tablet and full web page.
I used wireframes to sketch out a rough idea of how these would look on all three devices. This included all four pageson each device and all of its sections that were shown on a mobile device.

### Testing

I tested the css code using the W3 Jigsaw validation and it came out with no issues. I used the W3C Markup Validator for my html code and that did come with issues that were then rectified using W3Schools code to double check that my code still would work. The main issue I had was to get the audio player controls to come up on the audio section and play the track. I realised when I checked the folder I had the audio folder in the assets folder and this would not work until I removed it out of there. Suddenly once I had done this I could play the audio track in my audio page on the website. Getting the links to work was my main issue, but once I had the foie directory and the folders in the correct place the links worked more effectively.

## Deployment
My site was deployed on GitHub pages at https://epageone.github.io/Em-and-Me-Website/
I had some issues with my wireframes as some of them came up in error 404, however, they all work in the wireframes folder and were all working. 

## Credits

I based this website on the Resume mini project and used W3 Schools for code as well as Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com) for the bootstrap css and font awesome for the icons.
