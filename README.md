# Em & Me Band Website

## Description
The purpose of this site is to provide prospective fans and music fans to have a look at what we do and what we can offer to our local music commuity.

I wanted to create this website as I am a huge music fan and and musician and wanted to create my own bands website.

I built this website in order to showcase what I have learned so far through my Level 5 Diploma in Web Development through the [Code Institute] (https://codeinstitute.net)

Troughout this project so far I have grown in confidence using HTML and CSS and feel that I can code to a certain point and create a website that hopefully is user-friendly, something I previously could not but that is why I wanted to do this course. 

From studying the course material and other resources on the web, I have learned lots of different ways to get the ideas dfrom my head in to the code of my website. It's been a a huge learning curve and not as easy as I originally thought.

## UX Design
### Project Goals
My goals were to make this visually user-friendly and easy to use for the user. Also to make it established on all three devices such as mobile phone, tablet and full web page. 
I used wireframes to sketch out a rough idea of how these would look on all three devices.
